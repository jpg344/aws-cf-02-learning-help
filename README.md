# AWS CF-02 Learning Help

## Description

A plain homepage with menomics and pictures to learn for the AWS CF-02 certification.

## Installation steps

No installation needed since it's homepage with just html and css.

## How to use

Download the content of the repository or clone it with git.
Then simply open the ``index.html`` in the browser to see.

## Roadmap
Adding more than one service. I've gotten the certification before being able to put much time into this.
